# Terrain Editor — Agent Notes

Use `DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md` as the single source of truth for feature status and priority. Each section is sorted by completed, in-progress, and ideas so the next feature should be either in-progress or the first idea in that section.

## Working On The Next Feature

- Confirm the target area in `DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md`.
- Verify the expected user-facing behavior in `README.md` or `USER-GUIDE.md`.
- Update the roadmap entry when the feature is done.

## Useful Commands

- `npm run dev:viewer` / `npm run dev:editor` / `npm run dev:all`
  - Let the user run the dev commands; that'll let them preview the site in the background
- `npm run build:lib` / `npm run build:viewer` / `npm run build:editor`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:smoke`
- `npm run packmap`
