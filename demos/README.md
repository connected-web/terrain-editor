## Demos

- `viewer-ts/`: Vanilla Vite + TypeScript harness that boots the shared `initTerrainViewer` with assets fetched from hosted `.wyn` archives. Acts as the smoke-test for runtime loading.
- `viewer-vue3/`: (planned) Vue wrapper that embeds the viewer component and exercises reactive controls.
- `editor-vue3/`: (planned) Full editor SPA that will live alongside the main marketing site but can be developed independently.
