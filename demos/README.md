## Demos

- `viewer-ts/`: Vanilla Vite + TypeScript harness that boots the shared `initTerrainViewer` with assets fetched from hosted `.wyn` archives. Acts as the smoke-test for runtime loading.
- `viewer-vue3/`: Vue wrapper that embeds the viewer component and exercises reactive controls.
- `../editor/`: Primary editor workspace for importing Wyn archives, editing JSON, and previewing results.
